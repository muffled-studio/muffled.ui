# muffled.studio — Design System

Solo software studio. Builds software, apps, and products. Run by Josh Batley.

> **Tagline.** We build things. Mostly software. Some of it ships.

## Sources

This system was assembled from the brief and two logo SVGs:

- `uploads/LogoDark.svg` (logo for dark surfaces — paper crown on ink)
- `uploads/LogoLight.svg` (logo for light surfaces — ink crown on paper)

No codebase, Figma file, or product screens were attached. The voice, palette, type, and motif rules below come from the brief verbatim. If you have access to live products, ship them in and we'll fold them in.

## Content fundamentals

The voice is **dry, precise, direct, no fluff**. We use **"we"** (not "I", not "you"). No exclamation marks, ever. Sentences are short. Periods do the work.

**Casing.** Lowercase by default — including in product copy, labels, and most headings. Title-case only when a proper noun demands it. The brand is `muffled.studio`, lowercase, with the dot.

**Examples (in voice).**

- ✅ "we build things. mostly software. some of it ships."
- ✅ "we made a thing. it works. it's small."
- ✅ "shipped. tiny. useful."
- ❌ "We're so excited to announce…"  *(performative)*
- ❌ "You'll love how easy it is!" *(2nd-person, exclamation, hyperbole)*
- ❌ "Revolutionary new way to build apps" *(marketing slop)*

**Pronouns.** "we" for the studio. Avoid "you" — describe the thing, don't address the reader. If a sentence needs a subject, use "the app", "the thing", "this".

**Numbers and stats.** Only when real and useful. No vanity metrics, no charts-for-decoration.

**Punctuation.** Period > em-dash > comma. We don't use exclamation marks. We don't use semicolons unless prose demands it. Ellipses are fine, used literally.

**Emoji.** No.

**Vibe.** A workshop, not a showroom. Things are made here. The brand sounds like the back of a tool — stamped, terse, true.

## Visual foundations

### Palette
Two colors do almost all the work.

| Token | Hex | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--ink` | `#1A1A1A` | foreground on paper, background in dark mode |
| `--paper` | `#F5F5F5` | background, foreground on ink |
| `--u-red` | `#C0392B` | destructive, error, stop |
| `--u-green` | `#27AE60` | success, ship, go |
| `--u-amber` | `#D4830A` | warn, in-progress, hold |
| `--u-blue` | `#2471A3` | info, link, reference |

Utility colors are **functional**, never decorative. No gradients in surfaces. No tints "for warmth". Hierarchy comes from opacity stops on `--ink` (`/72`, `/56`, `/40`, `/24`, `/12`, `/06`) — there is no separate gray ramp.

### Type
Two families, two jobs.

- **Space Mono** — headings, eyebrows, code. Stamped and mechanical; it's the studio's voice on a sign. It ships **only 400 and 700** — don't ask it for in-between weights. Headings run 400; `h4`/`h5` and single-word emphasis run 700. Give it a hair of negative tracking at display sizes (`-0.02` to `-0.04em`); mono is wide, so don't crowd it.
- **Space Grotesk** — body, labels, UI copy, anything you actually read in quantity. Weights **300–700**; body is 400, labels 500, emphasis 600. Neutral tracking, `1.55` line-height for body.

The pairing is the point: mechanical mono headline, humanist grotesk underneath. Never set long body copy in the mono — it's a heading face. Never set a headline in the grotesk — that's the mono's job.

### Spacing
4px base unit. `4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 20 / 24 / 32 / 40 / 48 / 64 / 80 / 96`. We compose layouts from this scale. Nothing falls outside it.

### Radius
`6px` default. **Held loosely** — square corners (0px) are also fine where the shape feels stamped. `999px` is reserved for things that are genuinely round (avatars, status dots).

### Borders
**0.5px only.** Hairline. We don't have a 1px border. The rule is the rule. Color is `--ink-24` by default, `--ink-56` when the border is doing real separation work.

### Shadows
**None.** We don't ship a shadow system. Elevation is communicated by border, opacity, and order on the page. If a popover needs to feel above the page, give it a paper background, a 0.5px border, and let the surface beneath stay still.

### Backgrounds
Flat `--paper` or flat `--ink`. No images, no patterns, no textures, no gradients (except the subtle paint inside the logo itself, which is part of the mark and not used elsewhere). Full-bleed solids are fine. Generous whitespace is the texture.

### Animation
Two modes:

- **Drift** for transitions (mount, state change, theme swap). `220ms`, `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`. Calm, even.
- **Snap** for direct interactions (press, release, toggle). `90ms`, `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)`. Crisp, no overshoot.

**Nothing bounces.** No spring overshoots. No wobble. No keyframed loops on UI chrome.

### Hover & press states
- **Hover.** Opacity drop to `0.6` on the affected element, or surface wash to `--ink-06`. No color shifts.
- **Press.** Opacity to `0.4`. No scale shrink, no transform — the brand stays still.
- **Focus.** 0.5px outline at `--ink-56`, offset 2px. Same in dark mode (paper).

### Cards & surfaces
A card is `--paper` (or `--ink`), 0.5px `--border`, radius `6px`, no shadow, padding from the 4px scale. That's the whole recipe. Internal hierarchy is type weight + size, not boxes inside boxes.

### Transparency & blur
We use opacity for ink hierarchy. We don't use backdrop-blur — it produces a glassy, decorative feel that isn't ours. If something must overlay content, use solid `--paper` (or `--ink`) with a 0.5px border.

### Imagery
No stock. No grain filters. If product imagery is needed it should look like the actual product — flat screenshots on flat surfaces, no device frames, no perspective tilts. Imagery is reference, not décor.

### Layout
Generous outer margins. Single-column when the content is reading; two-column when the content is comparing. We don't fill space we don't need.

## Iconography

The brand has **no icon font** and no proprietary icon set in this drop. The system is intentionally text-first — labels do most of the work that icons usually do.

When an icon is genuinely needed:

- **Use Lucide** (CDN: `https://unpkg.com/lucide@latest`). Stroke icons match the 0.5–1px hairline language. Use stroke width `1.5px` for visual parity with our 0.5px borders rendered at typical UI scale.
- **Icon size** comes from the 4px scale: 12, 16, 20, 24px. Match the cap-height of adjacent type.
- **Color.** Currentcolor only. Icons inherit `--fg-1`, `--fg-2`, or a utility hue. No multicolor icons.
- **Spacing.** A `var(--s-2)` (8px) gap between icon and label. Mono needs air; cramming an icon next to mono feels noisy.

> **⚑ Substitution flagged.** Lucide is a placeholder. If you have a custom icon set, swap it in and update this section.

**Emoji.** No. Don't use emoji as decoration or status.

**Unicode glyphs.** Allowed sparingly when they're literally the right character: arrows (`→ ← ↑ ↓`), bullets (`·`), checks/crosses inside utility chips (`✓ ✕`), the registered/copyright marks. Never as a substitute for a real icon.

**Logo.** The mark is a **cuboid body** (the `F5F5F5` block / `1A1A1A` block depending on theme), a **swappable crown** (the parallelepiped on top — this is the variable element across product subbrands), and **fading legs** (the gradient verticals trailing down). Two colors, ever. **Never displayed below 24px**. Maintain a clear-space margin equal to the cuboid's short side.

## The one rule

**less.**
